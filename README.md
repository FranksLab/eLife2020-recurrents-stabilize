Code for figures in Bolding et al. 2020 (eLife)

This code reproduces figures from Bolding et al. eLife 2020;9:e53125. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53125
These MATLAB scripts were created and run in MATLAB 2016a.
You may be required to reinstall LIBLINEAR (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/) if classifier plots do not work.

To run any of these scripts:
1. Make sure the files from this GitHub repository are on your MATLAB path.
2. Download the data from the Data Dryad repository:
(https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.n2z34tmtj)
3. Navigate to the top-level folder fo the Data Dryad repository data such that you have subdirectories such as 'bulb', 'pcx', etc..
4. Run scripts contained in each Figure's folder
